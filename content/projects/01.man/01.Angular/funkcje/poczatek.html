	<h2>Angular JS is a library written in JS.</h2>
	<h3>When writing an application that uses angular it is required to include it
	</br>
		with the  &lsaquo; script &rsaquo; tag
		</br>
			locally - that is by downloading angular.js and including it
		</br>
			globally -  by including the same file by CDN (Content Developer Network)
	</h3>
	<h4>It is prefered to use the global method , because the client has the newest, most stable version of angulars library
		</br>
		Also this way makes the connection between the client and the server more efficient, by reducing the traffic.
		</br>
		Having a local copy gives independence from the internet connectionâ€¨
