In the first test the C language was the fastest one, also it's worth noting that there are different types of languages in this test. Compiled languages are leading, (the C language had better results than C++ becouse it didn't vary from the 0,003 mean). In the second test the C language also proved to be the fastest but there were some fluctuations from the mean. The script written in bash is also correct, but this language was not built for aiding in big math calculations, so the results will be omitted.
