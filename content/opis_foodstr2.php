                                The previous version was written in plain PHP with use of HTML, jQuery and MySQL, it worked but it was inefficient
                                - so now I'm redoing it with the laravel framework(v.5.5.3).
                                It's a gastronomic app, helping users to choose a restaurant - also it aids restaurants by giving them feedback (which is important in many ways).
